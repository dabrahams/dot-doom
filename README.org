See [[file:doom.org][doom.org]] for the source configuration file with full commentary. From this
file, three configuration files are generated: [[file:init.el][init.el]], [[file:packages.el][packages.el]] and
[[file:config.el][config.el]]. These are the files read by Doom Emacs.

The contents of this repository owes a great deal to the work of Diego Zamboni
<diego@zzamboni.org>, the author of [[https://leanpub.com/lit-config][Literate Configuration]]. I basically mashed
together [[https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/dot-doom][his config]] and my [[https://github.com/dabrahams/DotEmacs][previous config]].
